The Federal Communications Commission in the US is considering abandoning major components of network neutrality. This would legitimize "slow lanes" for network traffic that does not come from commercial partners of network providers. Sites where content is free, and generates no revenue - such as Project Gutenberg - would be at risk for downgraded speeds, access fees imposed by your network provider, or ads embedded by your network provider. Comments are solicited by the FCC at www.fcc.gov. Project Gutenberg encourages you to send messages to the FCC and your lawmakers, to express your views on this important issue.
